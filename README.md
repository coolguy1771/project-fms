# Project-FMS

## Introduction

This is a project for the course "Intro to Engineering" at Arizona State university. The goal of the project was to teach project management skills as well as basic javascript skills. We developed serveral "games" targeted to help patients recover from strokes. The drawing and signing games were written in p5js and the typing game was written in native [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) code. The UI was also written in svelte and design inspiration was taken from [Hajimari](https://hajimari.io).
